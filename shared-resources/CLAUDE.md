# Shared Resources

Shared data and business rules consumed by all prototype projects (web, mobile, iOS).

## Rules

1. **This is the single source of truth.** Edit data here — not in individual project `src/data/` directories. Web re-exports from here; mobile imports directly via `@shared` Vite alias.
2. **No project-specific imports.** Shared data files must not import from any project's `src/` directory (e.g. no `../translations/en`). Use `string` for translation keys — projects narrow the types locally.
3. **npm dependencies resolve via symlink.** `node_modules` symlinks to `base-surfaces-web/web/node_modules`. After running `npm install` in any project, shared-resources can resolve `@transferwise/icons`, `react`, etc.

## Balance rules

- **Total balance = current account + group account + jar.** Use `computeTotalBalance()` from `data/balances.ts` — never hand-roll the sum. This includes all accounts for the given account type.
- **No `formattedBalance` field.** Use `formatBalance(currency, 'symbol')` for `£948.70` or `formatBalance(currency)` for `948.70 GBP`. Display formatting derives from the `balance` number — never hardcode formatted strings.
- **All totals must be computed.** `groupTotalBalance` and `totalAccountBalance` use `.reduce()`. Never hardcode a balance total.
- **Balances are auto-computed from transactions.** Every currency's `balance` field uses `computeCurrencyBalance(code, txList)` from `transactions.tsx`. Never hardcode a balance number — change transactions and the balance updates automatically. The first transaction for each currency should be an "Add" (consumer) or "Receive" (business) that establishes the starting balance. If a balance goes negative after editing transactions, adjust the first transaction's amount.
- **"Taxes" is a group name, not an account type.** Code uses `groupCurrencies` / `isGroup` / `onNavigateGroupAccount`. Translation keys keep `'home.taxes'` etc. for the display name.

## Adding a new account, jar, or group

1. **Define transactions first** — the transaction array must exist before the currency definition so `computeCurrencyBalance()` can reference it.
2. **First transaction establishes the starting balance** — for consumer accounts use an "Add" transaction (`icon: <Plus />`), for business accounts use a "Receive" transaction (`icon: <Receive />`).
3. **Use `computeCurrencyBalance(code, txList)`** for the currency's `balance` field — never hardcode.
4. **Follow realism rules for transactions** — vary merchants (max 2× per currency), vary amount endings (not all .00/.99/.50), mix transaction types (card spend, sends, receives, conversions).
5. **Add the jar/group ID to `GROUP_IDS`** in `jar-data.tsx` if applicable.

## What stays per-project

- `nav.tsx` — navigation structure differs per platform
- `routing.md` — URL schemes are implementation-specific
- Design system docs — tokens, components, CSS are platform-specific
- Translations — each project has its own i18n strings
